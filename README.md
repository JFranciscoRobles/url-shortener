# Welcome to hpsurl-shortener!

Hello, this is a project for the **Planetscale-hackathon 2022**.

The rules of this **Hackathon** are to develop an **Open Source app** with **Planetscale** as serverless database provider.

This project is a **SaaS**, this system has a landing page, authentication module, user dashboard, dark mode, i18n module,  url shortener module, and metrics.

## Stack
These are the technologies we decided to use in our project.
- **Nextjs**: We decided to use NextJs as the framework for our web app, since we plan to use ISR, On demand ISR and Edge functions.
- **Planetscale**: A serverless database provider.
- **Prisma**: Our favourite ORM which has good compatibility with PlanetScale.
- **NextUI**: NextUI will be the component library that we will use, due to the short time of the Hackathon and that we do not have a Front-end developer.
- **Eslint**: Our favorite linting.
- **Typescript**
- **Yarn**
